# pmedian_semi_obnoxious
Library of benchmark instances for the p-median problem with distance constraints

This repository includes benchmark instances for the p-median problem with distance constraints. The problems under this repository are used in the following papers:

1. Ploskas, N. & Stergiou, K. (2022). Integer programming models for the semi-obnoxious p-median problem. https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05590

2. Ploskas, N. & Stergiou, K. (2022). Locating semi-obnoxious facilities under distance constraints. Annals of Mathematics & Artificial Intelligence (submitted)

Please cite the following papers if you use the instances.

The repository includes the following instances in separate folders:
1. "homogeneous_moreclients": instances where the number of clients is greater than or equal to the facilities
2. "homogeneous_morefacilities": instances where the number of facilities is greater than or equal to the facilities
3. "heterogeneous_moreclients": instances where the number of clients is greater than or equal to the facilities
2. "heterogeneous_morefacilities": instances where the number of facilities is greater than or equal to the facilities
